# OOP Review:
- Object: a thing that has state and behavior
- Class: a blueprint for an object
- Encapsulation: the idea that an object should contain all of the information and methods that are relevant to it
    - Implicit parameter:
        - The object on which the method is called
        During p1.findDistance(), the object referred to by p1 is the implicit parameter
        - The instance method can refer to that object's fields.
            - We say that it executes in the context of a particular object.
            - findDistance can refer to the x and y of the object it was called on.

- accessor: A method that lets clients examine object state.
    - Examples: distance, distanceFromOrigin
    - often has a non-void return type
- mutator: A method that modifies an object's state.
    - Examples: setLocation, translate
